# sumo-veins-mqtt-client-linux
This project embeds ASAM MQTT Clients into the Mobility Simulation Framework of Eclipse SUMO - OmNeT++ - Veins

Install:
1. SUMO https://github.com/eclipse/sumo
2. OmNeT++ http://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf
3. Veins https://github.com/sommer/veins
4. Replace https://github.com/sommer/veins/tree/master/src/veins/modules/application/traci by the traci folder

For testing purpose, use the default simulation scenario provided by Veins. 
The real simulation must be customized and synchronized with the scenario generated by the ASAM project according to the flow in the following paper.
